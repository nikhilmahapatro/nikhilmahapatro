# Hi, I'm Nikhil 👋

I'm a developer working at the intersection of **Applied Data Science, AI/ML, Generative AI**, and emerging **Agentic AI systems**.

My focus is simple: solve real-world problems using structured thinking, clean code, and scalable models whether it’s automating analysis, predicting outcomes, or building intelligent agents.

## 🧠 Domains I Work In

- Applied Machine Learning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Automation  
- Natural Language Processing (Summarization, Text Processing)  
- Generative AI (LLMs, Prompt Chaining)  
- Agentic AI (task-oriented autonomous flows)  
- Python-based ML pipelines and tooling

## 🔨 Projects That Reflect My Work

### 🔹 [WordSqueeze (NLP Summarizer)](https://github.com/nikhilmahapatro/WordSqueeze_-NLP)  
An extractive text summarizer built with NLTK and Streamlit. Lets users condense articles into 20–90% summaries or fixed-length outputs, with a clean interactive UI.  

### 🔹 [EDA Automation](https://github.com/nikhilmahapatro/EDA-Automation)  
A Python-based system that generates data profiling, visual analysis, and correlation maps — instantly. Think of it as one-click EDA.  

### 🔹 [Housing Price Predictor](https://github.com/nikhilmahapatro/Housing_Price_Predictor_-MLRegressions)
Regression-based modeling project that includes feature engineering, pipeline building, and real-world interpretability checks.  

### 🔹 [Pixel Whisperer](https://github.com/nikhilmahapatro/Pixel_Whisperer_-GenAI)
A lightweight GenAI tool built using Google's Gemini models. Upload a `.jpg` image and it returns a natural-language description. Built with Gradio for quick demos.

## 📚 Learning Repos

### 📁 [FullStack_DataScience_-_GenAI](https://github.com/nikhilmahapatro/FullStack_DataScience_-_GenAI)  
A collection of structured notebooks covering the foundations of regression, model performance metrics, Python ML tooling, and exploratory workflows.

### 📁 [Ethnus_MERN_FullStack](https://github.com/nikhilmahapatro/Ethnus_MERN_FullStack)  
Primarily used for frontend/backend structure understanding. Helpful context during early-phase integration tasks.
