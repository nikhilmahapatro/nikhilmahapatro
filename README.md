# Hi, I'm Nikhil 👋

I'm a developer working at the intersection of **Applied Data Science, AI/ML, Generative AI**, and emerging **Agentic AI systems**.

My focus is simple: solve real-world problems using structured thinking, clean code, and scalable models — whether it’s automating analysis, predicting outcomes, or building intelligent agents.

## 🧠 Domains I Work In

- Applied Machine Learning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Automation  
- Generative AI (LLMs, Prompt Chaining)  
- Agentic AI (task-oriented autonomous flows)  
- ML Model Evaluation & Optimization  
- Python-based ML pipelines and tooling

## 🔨 Projects That Reflect My Work

### 🔹 EDA Automation 
A Python-based system that generates data profiling, visual analysis, and correlation maps — instantly. Think of it as one-click EDA.

### 🔹 E-Vacc 
An AI-driven backend concept for managing vaccine bookings and routing using rule-based logic and prediction for slot allocation.

### 🔹 House Pricing Prediction 
Regression-based modeling project that includes feature engineering, pipeline building, and real-world interpretability checks.

## 📚 Learning Repos

### 📁 [FullStack_DataScience_-_GenAI](https://github.com/nikhilmahapatro/FullStack_DataScience_-_GenAI)  
A collection of structured notebooks covering the foundations of regression, model performance metrics, Python ML tooling, and exploratory workflows.

### 📁 [Ethnus_MERN_FullStack](https://github.com/nikhilmahapatro/Ethnus_MERN_FullStack)  
Primarily used for frontend/backend structure understanding. Helpful context during early-phase integration tasks.

## 🎯 Currently

- Working on agent-based automation systems using LLMs  
- Refining my EDA + ML workflow tools into usable utilities  
- Exploring ways to combine classical ML with generative capabilities  
- Building focused, clean projects — not bloated portfolios
