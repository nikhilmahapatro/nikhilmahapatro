## 🔨 Projects That Reflect My Work

### 🔹 EDA Automation (Coming Soon)
A Python-based tool that automates exploratory data analysis — generates summary stats, correlation maps, and plots in one go. Built to save time and bring structure to messy data.

### 🔹 E-Vacc (Coming Soon)
A full-stack app prototype for vaccine appointment booking. Built with the MERN stack, includes form validation, MongoDB integration, and basic user flow.

### 🔹 House Pricing Prediction (Coming Soon)
An end-to-end ML pipeline for predicting housing prices. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn.
